# Fuzzy64
Fuzzy64 is a modified version of [mupen64plus](https://github.com/mupen64plus) (N64 emulator) optimized for fuzzing or brute-forcing N64 games. Using [Lua](https://www.lua.org/) scripting, tests can be setup to look for glitches, optimal speed-running routes, or any other "experiments" you may wish to perform. It can perform these tests much faster than a traditional emulator by minizing resources needed and directly interfacing with an input plugin.

The latest version of N64-Fuzzer can be downloaded from the [Releases](https://github.com/danebouchie/Fuzzy64/releases) page. The contains a .zip file of the program and needs to be extracted. From here see the next section **Getting Started**.
